# Contributing to Reindeer
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as
possible.

The hope is that Reindeer will be useful to people throughout the Rust community.
However, since we've developed it as internal project to serve internal goals,
its unlikely to meet anyone else's requirements immediately, so we'd like to see
issues and PRs to add those features.

## Our Development Process
Reindeer's primary repository is mainained internally at Facebook, which is periodically
synced with github. Code changes are first merged with the internal version and
republished.

## Pull Requests
We actively welcome your pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. If you haven't already, complete the Contributor License Agreement ("CLA").

## Contributor License Agreement ("CLA")
In order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need
to do this once to work on any of Facebook's open source projects.

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.

Facebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe
disclosure of security bugs. In those cases, please go through the process
outlined on that page and do not file a public issue.

## Coding Style
Reindeer follows conventional Rust coding style, with a provided .rustfmt.toml for
formatting.
